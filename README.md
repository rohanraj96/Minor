# Minor project
I compared KNN, SVM and CNN for pedestrian attribute detection on the PETA Dataset for farview images of pedestrians. Each person
had 14 attributes. I used gray images for training KNN and SVM but RGB images for training CNN.
Due to limited compute power, the project was limited to only a few hundred training samples.
